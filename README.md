# Run_analysis-Code
ReadME. MD firle for Getting and Cleaning Data Project Run_analysis Project with movement data. 

Please Note: Actual Data Files are not uploaded due to the fact that GITHUB won't let me upload files of that size. I would have a x_train, y_train and x_test, and y_test data files. 

In this repository there is a tidy data set that came out of the uploaded run_analysis.r file. The Tidy dataset is named secTidySet.txt. 

Objectives of this exercise and resulting repository:

You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
