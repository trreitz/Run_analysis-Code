Explanation:

The first part of the R script in run_analysis.r unzips the data from the UCI dataset and saves it. I unzipped it as
phonemovement.zip. 

Then I need to merge the training and test datasets as is required by step one of the assignment. 
I then assign them column names and eventually merge the test and training into one mega dataset named SetAllInOne. 

I then fine the standard deviation and mean in ActivityID and SubjectID. 

I then create a seperate tidy data set with the average of each activity.
